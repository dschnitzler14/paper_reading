Anytime we make a decision based on statistical results we can get one of four outcomes, but two of those may be incorrect

1. Type I Error

- false positive
- this rejects a true null hypothesis
- this means a result is reported as "significant", when it isn't

2. Type II Error

- false negative
- this accepts a false null hypothesis
- this means a result is reported as "non-significant", when it actually is
- the likelihood of committing this type of error is related to the power of the statistical test, which is why it is important to carry out a power analysis
