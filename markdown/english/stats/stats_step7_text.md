The effect size is the strength or magnitude of difference between the groups, used to determine if the a statistically significant result is meaningful. This is also related to your power analysis - high-powered studies can detect medium effects, while low-powered studies may only help you determine large effects.

## Cohen's d

For comparing two groups (e.g. t-test), the most common method for assessing the size of the effect is by using Cohen's d

0.2 to 0.3 - "small" effect
0.5 - "medium" effect
0.8 to infinity - "large" effect.

## Partial eta^2

This is a measure of variance and can be used to calculate the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable. I can also be used to represent the effect size.

η^2 = 0.010 is a small association.
η^2 = 0.059 is a medium association.
η^2 = 0.138 or larger is a large association.
