You might be tempted to dive right in to you hypothesis testing, but there are two crucial elements to consider first - what type of data are you working with and what are the summary statistics?

## Data Types

Before proceeding with any analysis, you should first understand what type of data you are working with. Broadly, data fall into two main categories: scale (numeric) and categorical.

### Scale

These are measurements or counts, and can be further subdivided into

- Continuous
  e.g. height, weight, blood pressure,...

- Discrete
  e.g. number of children, number of hospital visits,...

### Categorical

This type of data can be subdivded into

- Ordinal
  ordered, e.g. Likert scale responses (1–5: strongly disagree to strongly agree), pain rating (mild, moderate, severe)

- Nominal
  not ordered e.g. country of birth, blood type, treatment group

Understanding what kind of data you are working with will inform what kind of summary statistics and hypothesis testing you can carry out.

## Summary Statistcs

Descriptive statistics do not test hypotheses. They describe what your data look like and is an essential step before running any inferential tests.

1. Distribution
   The distribution tells you how the values are spread across the dataset, with the frequency of each value. You can examine this with:

- frequency tables
- histograms
- box-plots

Overall, you want to look at how your data are distributed (e.g. normal or not-normal), if it is skewed in any direction, and if there are outliers.

2. Measures of central tendency
   The averages of the values to find the centre of the data.

- mean: most common; the arithmetic average
- median: the middle value when the data are ordered from smallest to largest
- mode: the most frequent value - a dataset can have more than one mode (e.g. bimodal or multimodal)

3. Measures of variability
   What the spread of the values is and how different they are from one-another.

- range: how far apart the two extremes of the data are
- standard deviation: most common, average amount of variability - tells you how far, on average, each score lies from the mean
- variance: the average of squared deviations from the mean - tells you the degree of difference
- interquartile range: the range of the middle 50% of the data (from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile) - can be useful for skewed data
