    Main Concept
  </div>
  A statistical test compares your data to what you’d expect to see <b>if the null hypothesis were true</b>.

<p class="ps-lede">Don't worry, you don't actually need to do any maths for this though! These are defined formulae that allow you to drop your data and variables in.</p>

<p class="ps-lede">In your test you calculate the appropriately named <span class="ps-highlight-term">test statistic</span>, which measures how far your observed result is from what you would expect if there were no real effect (i.e. the null hypothesis). If the null hypothesis is true, most values of this statistic fall within a typical range, and the difference calculated would be none. <span class="ps-highlight-critical">The further your value lies from that range, the more unusual your data are under the null hypothesis</span>.</p>

    In plain English
  </div>
  Assuming there is absolutely no difference between the groups, we expect the test statistic to be zero (for an ANOVA it is F=1, because - maths).

    Depending on the statistical test you are carrying out, you will have different test statistic terms.

### Common test statistics

| Test statistic | Null hypothesis (H₀)                                   | Alternative hypothesis (H₁)           | Used in               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| t              | The means of two groups are equal                      | The means of two groups are not equal | t-test, regression    |
| z              | The means of two groups are equal                      | The means of two groups are not equal | z-test                |
| F              | Group means do not differ more than expected by chance | At least one group mean differs       | ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA |
| χ²             | Variables are independent                              | Variables are associated              | Chi-square test       |
| r              | There is no linear relationship                        | There is a linear relationship        | Correlation tests     |

<p class="ps-lede">The test statistic is used to calculate the <span class="ps-highlight-term">p-value</span>, which estimates how likely it is that you would see the difference described by the test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the p-value, the further away from the range predicted by the null hypothesis. If there is truly no difference, then the p-value will be close to 1.</p>
