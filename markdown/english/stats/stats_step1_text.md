Statistical tests are required to test a hypothesis and can be used to

- estimate the difference between two (or more) groups
- determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between predictor and outcome variables

Don't worry, you don't actually need to do any maths for this though! These are defined formulae that allow you to drop your data and variables in.

In your test you calculate the appropriately named "test statistic", which describes how closely the distribution of your data matches predicted distribution of the null hypothesis. Depending on the statistical test you are carrying out, you will have different test statistic values, but here are some common ones:

You also calculate the p-value, more on that later.

Depending on the data you have, you will have to decide if you want to carry out a parametric or non-parametric test. The former are more powerful than the latter, meaning you are more likely to detect real differences, however, there are certain assumptions that need to be met for the maths to work correctly. More on that later too!
