A p-value is the probability value, which estimates how likely it is that you would see the difference described by the test statistic **if the null hypothesis of the relationship is true**.

> It is probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as ours **if the null is true** and there really is no difference or association in the population of interest.

The cutoff for determining if a p-value is significant, by convention is 5%, which is usually written out as 𝜶 = 0.05. In other words, if there truly is no effect, we would only expect to see results this extreme (or more extreme) about 5 times out of 100 purely due to random variation.

This cutoff is about controlling false positives, not about proving something is true - more on Type I and Type II errors later.

**What a p-value is not:**

- ❌ It is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

The p-value assumes the null hypothesis is true and asks how unusual your data would be under that assumption.

- ❌ It is not the probability that your results happened “by chance.”

Random variation is already built into the statistical model.

- ❌ It is not a measure of how big or important an effect is.

A tiny effect can have a very small p-value if the sample size is large.

- ❌ It is not proof that your alternative hypothesis is correct.

A “significant” result does not automatically confirm your theory.
