Since it would be impossible to measure an entire population, researchers use sample data to make inferences about the whole population. However, there is some natural variability between groups

A confidence interval with 95% confidence level, means that you are confident that 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval. In other words, a confidence interval is a way to measure how well the sample represents the population being studied.

There is also a relationship between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals! The confidence level is determined by calculating 1-𝜶, and 𝜶 is typically 0.05.
