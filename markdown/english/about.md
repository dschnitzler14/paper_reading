## About the Paper Reading App

This Paper Reading App is a teaching-focused web app designed to help students learn how to read scientific papers effectively.

Rather than focusing on speed or shortcuts, the app emphasises:

- understanding paper structure
- developing reading strategies
- learning how to interpret figures and methods
- reflecting critically on evidence

It is intended for use in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, journal clubs, and self-guided study.
