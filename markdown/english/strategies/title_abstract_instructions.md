The title and abstract are designed to give you a general idea of what a paper is about. It is a good idea to skim-read the abstract first, to decide if you want to read more.

This also gives a good summary of work done! No need to pass it to generative AI!

Remember to rate this title too (Note: this may be easier to do when you have completed the paper, as you can't really judge yet if the title is appropirate, so do come back here after you have worked through the other sections.)

⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> Abstracts summarise what the authors thought was important and can sometimes make the research sound more outstanding than it was. It is important to not rely only on an abstract.
