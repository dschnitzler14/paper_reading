Overall, this paper has some significant flaws that make it difficult to trust the results.

There are still a number of open questions in the experimental design, making the interpretation unreliable.

- unclear what the recovery period was between implatation surgery and experimental begin
- "group housing" - while the authors do address this as a limitation, surely a group needs to be bigger than a pair. Also, were the animals always paired with the same rat? This could add an additional stress
- the isolation did not take into account that rats also communicate through sounds and smell, not just vision
- the acute restraint stress and the fasting procedure is unclear - why?
- there was no power analysis to determine the number of rats required/ group. Group numbers seem to be arbitary, on top of fluctating for different experiments. The authors did not describe what the exclusion criteria were or how they arrived at n=4 for the plasma proteins
- the statistical analysis is very suspicious - they report using Tukey's posthoc, but do not report that they carried out an ANOVA, nor do they report test statistic in the results
- at one point in the methods they report food intake to be "significantly increased" but do not report any test statistic or p-values.
- I struggle to see that the difference in muscle/body weight ratio is meaningfully statistically different (~0.38% vs ~0.36%).
- the discussions seems to hinge a lot on speculation and slight overinterpretation of results
- typo of oxyntic glads as oxygenated glands is a major oversight

While they did only use male rats in this study, and it is considered good practice to carry out studies in both males and females, given that social isolation disproporionately affects elderly men (as described in their introduction), I don't see a problem with this.
