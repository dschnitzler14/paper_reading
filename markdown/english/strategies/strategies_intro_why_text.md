There are many different reasons you might read a scientific paper. For example, you might be looking to:

- find a specific method or protocol
- understand the background or theoretical context of a topic
- see how a particular analysis was performed
- identify gaps to inform your own research or plan a new study
- check how results compare with findings from other papers

> In this case, we’re reading the paper to understand one specific study, and we’re
assuming we’re approaching it as novices. That means our focus is on building understanding, not mastering every technical detail.
