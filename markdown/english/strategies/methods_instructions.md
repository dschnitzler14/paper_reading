    <h4>Focus on general method</h4>
    Methods can be very dense, as they are meant for other researchers to fully replicate the experimental set up. As such, they contain a lot of information that is likely not relevant to you, such as the exact compositions of solutions. Just focus on that fact <i>that</i> they did an ELISA in order to quantify plasma protein concentrations, rather than the details of how.

    <h4>Abbreviations</h4>
    Make a note or highlight any abbreviations used - you might end up in the results wondering what "ABB+" and "ABB-" means! It is common for authors to use unusual or unique abbreviations.

    <h4>Apply Common Sense</h4>
    You don't need to be an expert in a specific method to apply common sense! If something seems odd to you or doesn't quite add up, make a note of it!
