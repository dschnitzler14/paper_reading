Alright! So now we know:

- *why* the authors carried out the study and what gap in the knowledge they were trying to address
- *how* the study was designed and conducted
- *what* the results of the experiments were

In the Discussion, the authors place their findings into a wider context. This is where they explain how they interpret the results, relate them to previous work, and consider what the findings might mean beyond this specific study.

You’ll also often find alternative interpretations, suggestions for future research, and, importantly, a discussion of the study’s limitations. Remember, no study is ever perfect. Limitations are normal and expected; failing to acknowledge them doesn’t mean the study was flawless, it means the authors may be overstating the strength or impact of their conclusions.
