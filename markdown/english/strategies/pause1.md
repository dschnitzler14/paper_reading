Okay, let's pause here for a moment.

You’ve read the Introduction, Methods, and Results. Before we move on, let’s make sure we’re clear on what the paper has actually shown (and what it hasn’t).

Step by step: what do we know so far?

1. Introduction: What problem are the authors tackling and what is their hypothesis?

2. Methods: What did they do, and how did they measure it?

3. Results: What did they find? Shown in the figures and in the text?

Before we move on, let's also think about the Discussion.

- What do you expect the authors to say in the Discussion?
- How will they interpret the results?
- What limitations might they mention?
- Based on the evidence, what claims would be reasonable?

Your conclusion
