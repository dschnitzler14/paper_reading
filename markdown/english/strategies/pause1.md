Okay, let’s pause here for a moment.

You’ve read the Introduction, Methods, and Results. Before we move on, let’s make sure we’re clear on what the paper has actually shown, and what it has not shown.

    Before you read the Discussion
  </div>
  The Discussion is where the authors explain what they think the results mean and how the findings fit into a wider context. Before you read it, make a prediction. This helps you spot strong reasoning and also notice when the interpretation goes beyond the data.
  <ul class="ps-list">
        <li><span class="ps-dot"></span><span>What do you expect the authors to claim based on the results?</span></li>
        <li><span class="ps-dot"></span><span>How do you think they will interpret the findings?</span></li>
        <li><span class="ps-dot"></span><span>What limitations should they acknowledge?</span></li>
        <li><span class="ps-dot"></span><span>Based on the evidence so far, what claims would be reasonable?</span></li>
    </ul>
