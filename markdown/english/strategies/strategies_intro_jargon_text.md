Don’t worry, this isn’t insurmountable. Reading scientific papers is a skill, not a talent. Like any skill, it can be learned, practised, and improved over time.

Rather than reading every word from top to bottom, it helps to take a methodical approach. This keeps you focused on the most important questions a paper is trying to answer:

- Introduction: skim to understand the rationale and identify the hypothesis **WHY**
- Methods: skim to grasp the general approach, note key abbreviations, and watch for red flags **HOW**
- Results: read carefully here; this is where the data are presented **WHAT**
- Discussion: read critically to see how the authors interpret their findings **SO WHAT**
