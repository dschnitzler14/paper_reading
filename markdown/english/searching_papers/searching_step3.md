Many databases allow Boolean searching using **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** (these must be uppercase).

- AND to narrow your search

Use AND to require both terms.

> hippocampus AND memory

This finds papers that mention both hippocampus and memory.

- OR to include synonyms or alternate spelling

Use OR when authors might use different words

> memory OR learning

> synthesise OR synthesize

This helps avoid missing relevant studies.

- NOT to exclude irrelevant results

Use NOT to remove unwanted topics.

> NOT "machine learning"

Useful when a term appears in multiple contexts.
