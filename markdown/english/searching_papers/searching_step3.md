Many databases (such as OpenAlex) allow Boolean searching using **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** (these **must be uppercase**).

- AND — narrow your search

Use AND to require both terms.

This finds papers that mention _both_ hippocampus _and_ memory.

- OR — include synonyms

Use OR when authors might use different words

This helps avoid missing relevant studies.

- NOT — exclude irrelevant results

Use NOT to remove unwanted topics.

Useful when a term appears in multiple contexts.
