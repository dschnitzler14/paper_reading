Now that you know how to read a scientific paper, the next challenge is figuring out how to find the right papers in the first place.

At first, this can feel overwhelming. There are millions of scientific papers, spread across decades, journals, and disciplines. Typing a few words into a search bar often returns either thousands of results or papers that seem only loosely related to what you care about. It’s easy to feel lost or unsure where to begin.

The good news is that finding papers is a skill too. Researchers don’t magically know the “right” paper to read - they use structured search strategies to narrow a huge literature down to a manageable, relevant set. With the right approach, you can go from “everything about the brain” to a focused list of papers that actually answer your question.

In this section, you’ll learn:

- how to turn a broad topic into a clear, searchable question
- how to choose effective keywords
- how to use Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) to control what appears in your results
- how to quickly judge whether a paper is worth reading further

These strategies work whether you’re doing background reading for a course, preparing for a journal club, or starting a research project. You don’t need to read everything — you just need to know how to search smartly.

Once you’ve read through the guide, you can try it out yourself below and practice building searches that return fewer, better, and more relevant papers.
