I'd give this paper **3.5 out of 5 stars** (rounding to either 3 or 4 depending on the context).

## Why not higher:

- **Age mismatch with stated goals**: They're motivated by elderly isolation but study young rats, which significantly limits the relevance of their findings
- **Missing mechanistic depth**: They measure multiple biomarkers but don't establish whether these are causes or consequences of the behavioral changes
- **Limited translational clarity**: Unclear how "alternating daily" would apply to real-world human interventions
- **Small sample sizes** (especially n=4 for some plasma measures)
- **Unresolved cage density confound** that could explain some activity differences

## Why not lower:

- **Novel and testable hypothesis**: The intermittent intervention approach is creative
- **Methodologically sound**: Generally well-executed within its scope
- **Consistent results**: The intervention clearly worked across multiple outcome measures
- **Honest limitations**: Authors acknowledge some weaknesses (age group, preliminary nature)
- **Good foundation**: Sets up important follow-up questions

It's a solid exploratory study that makes a meaningful contribution to the literature on social isolation, but it raises more questions than it answers. It would be a stronger paper with: (1) aged rats, (2) mechanistic experiments, (3) dose-response testing (what's the minimum social contact needed?), and (4) controlled cage density.

**Perfect for**: A specialized journal's audience interested in early-stage findings
**Needs work for**: High-impact general science journals or direct clinical translation
