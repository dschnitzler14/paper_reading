This is a well-designed and potentially valuable study examining whether intermittent breaks from social isolation can mitigate its negative physical effects. Here are my thoughts:

## Strengths

**Novel intervention approach**: The core finding—that alternating between isolation and group housing every other day can prevent most negative effects of continuous isolation—is genuinely interesting and has practical implications. This "intermittent breaking" strategy is creative and hasn't been extensively studied before.

**Comprehensive outcome measures**: The researchers examined multiple interrelated systems (behavioral, muscular, hormonal), which provides a more complete picture of isolation's effects and the intervention's efficacy.

**Clear results**: The intervention group consistently matched the control group across nearly all measures, while the isolated group showed significant impairments. This clean pattern strengthens the conclusions.

## Limitations and Concerns

**Age group**: The authors acknowledge studying only young adult rats (starting at 8 weeks old) as a "preliminary study," but their stated motivation is addressing elderly isolation. The physiological responses to isolation differ substantially by age, so extrapolating to elderly populations is problematic.

**Cage density confound**: They acknowledge but don't adequately address that isolated rats had more space per animal. This could influence physical activity independent of social factors.

**Sample size**: With only 8 rats per group (and some analyses using n=4), the study may be underpowered to detect smaller effects or interactions.

**Mechanism unclear**: While they measured multiple biomarkers, the study doesn't establish causal relationships between the hormonal changes and behavioral outcomes.

**Translation to humans**: The intervention (alternating daily between isolation and socializing) may not be realistic for isolated elderly humans. What's the practical human equivalent?

## Clinical Relevance

The implications for human isolation (especially during events like the COVID-19 pandemic) are intriguing but require cautious interpretation. The paper would benefit from more discussion of how "intermittent social contact" could be operationalized in human interventions—is it weekly visits? Phone calls? What's the minimum effective "dose"?

Overall, it's a solid proof-of-concept study that opens interesting questions, though it needs follow-up work with older animals and clearer mechanistic understanding before informing human interventions.
