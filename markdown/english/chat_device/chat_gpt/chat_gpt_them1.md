Overall, this is a solid, clearly written experimental paper with a simple but conceptually interesting intervention: *intermittently* breaking isolation rather than fully eliminating it. The authors show that alternating rats between single housing and group housing every other day largely prevents the reductions in locomotor activity and muscle mass seen in fully isolated animals, and partially normalizes stress- and metabolism-related hormones (corticosterone, ghrelin, myostatin) .

**Strengths**

* The design is straightforward and well controlled: three groups (group-housed, isolated, and intermittent “intervention”) with identical environmental conditions otherwise.
* Continuous locomotor monitoring with implantable nanotags gives objective, high-resolution activity data.
* The study integrates behavioral, physiological, and endocrine outcomes, which strengthens the biological plausibility of the conclusions.
* The intervention is conceptually translational: it models a realistic human scenario where complete elimination of isolation may be impossible, but partial social contact might still be beneficial.

**Limitations**

* Sample sizes are modest, especially for plasma biomarkers (n = 4 in Fig. 3), which limits statistical power and robustness.
* Only young male rats were used; sex differences and aging effects—highly relevant for human social isolation—are not addressed.
* The isolation model conflates social isolation with changes in cage density and space; the authors acknowledge this, but it remains a confound.
* The intervention is binary (every other day). It does not explore dose–response relationships (e.g., how little social contact is “enough”?).
* Translational claims to humans are necessarily speculative; rat social stress does not fully capture the complexity of human isolation.

**Interpretation**
The data convincingly show that *complete* isolation reduces activity and relative muscle mass and alters hormones, while *partial* relief from isolation largely prevents these effects. The paper’s main contribution is reframing social isolation as something whose harms may scale with *duration* rather than being all-or-nothing. That idea is both biologically plausible and clinically appealing.

In short, it’s a well-executed preclinical study with a modest scope but a clear message: even limited, intermittent social contact may meaningfully buffer the physical consequences of isolation.
