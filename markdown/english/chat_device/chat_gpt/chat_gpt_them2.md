I’d give it **3.5 out of 5 stars**.

It’s a well-designed and clearly reported animal study with a nice, intuitive idea—showing that *partial* relief from isolation can blunt its physical effects. The methods are sound, the results are coherent, and the conclusions are appropriately cautious for a rat model .

What holds it back from a higher score are its modest sample sizes (especially for hormone assays), limited scope (young male rats only), and the fact that the “intervention” is fairly coarse (every other day, no dose–response). It’s more incremental than transformative, but it does add a useful conceptual twist to the social isolation literature.

So: solid, credible, and interesting—just not field-changing.
