Comments



Scientific rigor
★★★★☆
The experimental design is clear, with appropriate control, intervention, and multiple physiological endpoints. Statistical methods are sound (ANOVA with Tukey post‑hoc, p &lt; 0.05).


Innovation
★★★★☆
Introducing “intermittent breaking” of isolation is a novel approach that directly tests a feasible mitigation strategy.


Data quality
★★★★☆
Use of implanted nanotag sensors provides high‑resolution activity data, and hormone assays cover key stress‑related pathways (corticosterone, ghrelin, myostatin).


Translational relevance
★★★☆☆
The link to human frailty and social isolation is well argued, but the model uses only young male rats and a short 3‑week period, limiting direct extrapolation to older or clinical populations.


Clarity &amp; presentation
★★★★☆
The manuscript is well‑organized, with clear figures and concise discussion of mechanisms. Minor improvements could be made in addressing cage‑density confounds and expanding demographic diversity.


Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the literature on social isolation and physiological health, especially by showing that brief, regular social contact can offset many negative effects observed under continuous isolation. The primary limitation is the narrow animal model, which prevents a full 5‑star rating.
