## Welcome: How to Read a Scientific Paper

Reading scientific papers can feel overwhelming, especially if no one has ever explained how you’re supposed to read them.

This app is here to change that.

Instead of throwing a full paper at you and hoping for the best, this app breaks the process down into small, manageable steps and shows you what to focus on at each stage.
