# Methods

Rats were maintained on either a standard chow or high-fat diet prior to behavioural testing. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. `r actionLink(ns("practice_wrong_section4"), "Given accumulating evidence that nutritional composition can influence hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis function and behavioural reactivity to stressors, it is important to clarify how increased dietary fat intake may shape stress-related phenotypes.", class = "invisible_yellow")` Data were analysed using two-way ANOVA.
