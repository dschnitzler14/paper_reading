Environmental enrichment was associated with increased expression of neuronal growth markers in the hippocampus. Enriched mice also performed better on the novel object recognition task compared with standard-housed controls. `r actionLink(ns("practice_wrong_section5"), ""), "Taken together, these data support the interpretation that experience-dependent hippocampal plasticity may underlie the observed enhancement in recognition memory, consistent with prior reports linking structural remodelling within the dentate gyrus to improved cognitive performance.", class = "invisible_yellow")`
