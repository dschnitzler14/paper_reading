> Caffeine acts through neuronal adenosine A2A receptors to prevent mood and memory dysfunction triggered by chronic stress


Repeated stress elicits neurochemical and morphological changes that negatively affect brain functioning (1, 2). Thus, repeated stress is a trigger or a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, namely depression, in both humans and animal models (2, 3). Given the absence of effective therapeutic tools, novel strategies to manage the impact of chronic stress are needed, and analyzing particular lifestyles can provide important leads. Notably, caffeine consumption increases in stressful conditions (4) and correlates inversely with the incidence of depression (5, 6) and the risk of suicide (7, 8). `r actionLink(ns("practice_intro2_mystery1"), "However, the molecular targets operated by caffeine to afford these beneficial effects have not been defined. ", class = "invisible_yellow")` Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug. The only molecular targets for caffeine at nontoxic doses are the main adenosine receptors in the brain, namely the inhibitory A1 receptors (A1R) and the facilitatory A2A receptors (A2AR) (9). A2AR blockade affords robust protection against noxious brain conditions (10), an effect that might result from the ability of neuronal A2AR to control aberrant plasticity (11, 12) and synaptotoxicity (13–15) or from A2AR’s impact on astrocytes (16) or microglia (17). The protection provided by A2AR blockade prompts the hypothesis that A2AR antagonism may underlie the beneficial effects of caffeine on chronic stress, in accordance with the role of synaptic (18, 19) or glial dysfunction (20) in mood disorders. Thus, A2AR antagonists prolonged escape behavior in two screening tests for antidepressant activity (21–23) and prevented maternal separation-induced longterm cognitive impact (12). We combined pharmacological and tissue-selective A2AR transgenic mice (24, 25) to test if neuronal A2AR controlled the modifications caused by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS).
