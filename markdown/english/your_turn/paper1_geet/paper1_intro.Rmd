Caffeine is the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive  substance but like many other psychoactive substances it is legal and unregulated in all countries of the world. The chemical name is 1,3,7,-trimethyl-1H purine-2,6(3H,7H)-Dionne, also named as 1,3,7,trimethyl xanthenes or 7 methyl theophylline. Its molecular formula is C8H10N4O2 and molecular mass 194.19g/mole. It is an odourless white crystalline substance or powder. Because of its liquefactive nature and worldwide usage, a lot of work has been done and obtained quite contradictory results by different groups. It was presumed that caffeine is a major source of antioxidants contributing up to 65% of dietary supplement. Epidemiologic studies have found that ingestion of coffee is associated with reduced biomarkers of oxidative stress1 and helpful in reduction of morbidity in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, ischemic perfusion, ulcerative colitis, diabetes, sexual type of neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis (2). Adenosine is a potent vasodilator but caffeine, an adenosine analogue competitively inhibits the adenosine receptors and brings out vasoconstriction. The psychoactive effects of caffeine are due to the blockade of adenosine receptors of brain. It can increase the systolic blood pressure by enhancing angiotensin II and epinephrine. It can also increase the heart rate by increasing the levels of catecholamines.
