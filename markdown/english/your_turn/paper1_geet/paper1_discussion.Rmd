Under resting conditions caffeine has been shown to cause increase in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance3. Azra mohammed et al4 have shown that caffeine can change stiffness of blood vessels may be independent of blood pressure changes. They here also shown that arterial stiffness increases with caffeine and pressor effect of caffeine is predominantly on the vessel resistance rather than an increase in the cardiac output. They also claim that the increase in the sympathetic nervous system activity, serum adrenaline and rennin have been linked, the acute pressor effect is also seen in adrenelectamised patients. Jonson w. daniels et al3 showed that angiotensin II levels were increased with caffeine. As we know that angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor, it causes increase in blood pressure. In the present study we noticed increase in values of blood pressure after caffeine intake which clearly substantiates the above statement. Angiotensin II (ANG) potently enhances catecholamine release from the peripheral sympathetic system5. Catecholamines released by this mechanism contribute to the vasoconstricting and sodium-retaining properties of ANG6. In particular, the chronic effects of ANG at moderately elevated levels are promoted by adrenergic pathways that are significantly involved in the development of hypertension7, 8. Catecholamines can also cause increase in heart rate. Caffeine with its multiple effects is (1) an adenosine receptor blocker. (2) increasing levels of angiotensin II (3) increasing the levels of catecholamines. In the present study, an increase in the values of heart rate and blood pressure were noticed with the intake of caffeine when compared to placebo. It has been explained due to the above said multiple effects of caffeine.
