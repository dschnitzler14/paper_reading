Experiment 1:

- All levels of exercise intensity reduced food intake compared to the control, at all three timepoints
- The maximum effect was seen at 54m/ min intensity

Experiment 2:

- cFos expression increased significantly in brain regions associated with feeding and body weight
- This confirms previous results but also demonstrates involvement of 2 new brain regions not previously captured
