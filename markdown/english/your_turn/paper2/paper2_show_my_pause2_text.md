Experiment 1:

- rats were subjected to forced treadmill exercise at 3 different levels of intensity (controls: no exercise) and food intake was over 3 hours following exercise was measured

Experiment 2:

- having determined the most impactful intensity of exercise, rats were subjected to forced treadmill exercise, then sacrificed in order to examine activation (cFOS expression) of brain regions involved in feeding and weight.
- the frontal cortex was used as control as there is no evidence that this region plays a role in mediating feeding
