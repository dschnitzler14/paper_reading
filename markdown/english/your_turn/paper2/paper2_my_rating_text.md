Overall this is a well-designed study, that isn't overly convoluted. The authors set out to create a baseline of the effects of forced treadmill exercise in male rats due to the incongruency across the literature for different models of exercise and involvement of central mechanisms.

While the table demonstrates significant differences across multiple different brain regions, the figure only shows the PVN and CeA, which may be a case of minor cherry-picking, as these results may be more dramatic than the others shown in the table.

The discussion lacks clear descriptions of the limitations, however overall, the authors do a good job of discussing the obtained results, without overreaching or speculating too widely about the downstream effects of cfos expression.
