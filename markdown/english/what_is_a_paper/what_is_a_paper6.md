    Main Concept
  </div>
    Scientific publishing is not static, and neither is science itself. Many of the challenges are widely recognised and actively debated. Researchers, institutions, funders, and publishers are all experimenting with new models designed to improve transparency, fairness, accessibility, and rigour.

      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        Careers are often shaped by publication count, journal prestige, and citation metrics. This can prioritise quantity over quality and discourage replication or rigorous incremental work.

      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        Citation metrics are frequently used as shortcuts for judging quality. While informative, they can oversimplify contributions and distort what is rewarded in academic careers. For some, they have become the goal, incentivising high volumes of publication.

      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        Researchers in well-funded institutions often have better access to journals, publication funds, and infrastructure, widening global inequities in participation.

      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        Peer review relies on a small group of volunteer researchers. Increasing submission rates can lead to delays and make it difficult to find appropriate experts for specialised methods.

    Progress & Reform
  </div>

From Open Science practices to preprints, open peer review, data sharing initiatives, and alternative evaluation systems, there is a growing movement to make research more transparent and equitable.

  Understanding the limitations of the system does not weaken science! It makes you a more critical reader and a more responsible researcher.
