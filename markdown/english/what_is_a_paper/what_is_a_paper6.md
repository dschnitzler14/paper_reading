## 1. Publish or perish

Academic careers are often shaped by publication count, journal prestige, and citation metrics. This pressure can incentivise quantity over quality, discourage replication studies, and reward “positive” or novel findings over careful, incremental work.

## 2. Metrics incentives

Citation-based metrics are often used as shortcuts for judging quality. While metrics can provide useful information, they can also oversimplify complex research contributions and distort incentives, when these metrics are used to define career success, such as funding opportunities!

## 3. Access inequality

Researchers in well-funded institutions often have better access to paywalled journals, publication funds, and infrastructure. This can widen global inequities in who gets to participate fully in scientific conversations.

## 4. Limited peer reviewer pool

Peer review relies on a relatively small group of active researchers who volunteer their time. As submission rates increase, the same reviewers are repeatedly asked to evaluate papers, leading to delays. In addition, it can sometimes be difficult to find reviewers with the right expertise for highly specialised or niche methods. This means important methodological details may not always receive the level of scrutiny they require, simply because the appropriate experts are scarce or overextended.

## 5. Bias in peer review

Peer review is essential, but it is not immune to bias, whether conscious or unconscious. Reviewer selection, disciplinary norms, and prestige effects can all influence outcomes.

## 6. Reproducibility issues.

Limited data sharing, selective reporting, and methodological opacity can make it difficult to replicate findings, undermining trust in published research.

## 7. Journal profit models.

Many major journals are owned by large commercial publishers that charge high subscription fees and article processing charges (APCs). This can restrict access to knowledge and create financial barriers for researchers who cannot afford to publish in or even read certain journals.

# But do not despair!

Scientific publishing is not static, and neither is science itself. Many of the challenges we’ve discussed are widely recognised and actively debated. Researchers, institutions, funders, and publishers are all experimenting with new models designed to improve transparency, fairness, accessibility, and rigour.

From Open Science practices to pre-prints, open peer review, and alternative evaluation systems, there is a growing movement toward making research more robust and more equitable.

Importantly, awareness is power! Understanding the limitations of the system does not make science weaker, it makes you a more critical reader and a more responsible researcher.
