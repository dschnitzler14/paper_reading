# Different Types of Publication

Science is an iterative process, and so is scientific publishing.

## Traditional/ Pay-walled
In traditional publishing, you submit a paper to a journal, which gets passed to an editor or editorial team. They will look over it and decide whether or not they would like to publish your work. At this point, your paper gets passed to peer reviewers - these are your _peers_ in the field. The editor will contact different reviewers asking them to read your paper and give their feedback and comments. This can sometimes take time, as peer review is _voluntary_, meaning peer reviewers do not get paid for their work, but most scientists will engage in it because they understand the importance of scientific publishing. The reviewers are people who understand the work too - for example if you submit a paper about stress and metabolism, the editor will find reviewers who understand this particular area of research. It can get a little tricky though, finding peer reviewers who are experts in niche or novel methods.

Peer review is often done blinded - either the reviewers can't see your details, and more commonly, you cannot see who the reviewers are. When they have read your paper and added their feedback, the paper will be returned to you with comments. At this point, you make the suggested edits or sometimes head back to the lab for additional work, to make a stronger or more convincing argument. Sometimes though, you might disagree and have a good reason for doing so, which is also a valid response. When you are ready, you resubmit this to the reviewers, who will look over your response and your changes. Once everyone is happy, the paper is finally accepted for publication.

If you are publishing in a traditional journal, you will have to be "Article Processing Charges" (APCs) - these fees can be quite high, depending on the journal you are publishing in. Additionally, if you opt to have your paper published Open Access, the fees can be even higher.

There are different tiers of Open Acess within traditional journals - green and gold. Green means the paper is embagoed for a while and stays behind a paywall for a certain length of time, while gold means that it is immediately accessible.

Remember, unless you publish Open Acess, readers have to pay to access and read your paper too. Usually, University and Institute libraries pay these fees - which is why you may be asked to "log in via your Institue" when you visit a site to read a paper.

You might be asking yourself at this point why people opt for the traditional route and the answer is: metrics, visibility, and perceived credibility. Traditional journals are indexed and have "Journal Impact Factors", meaning you can gain "Science Points", which in turn can influence your opportunities - this is where the "publish or perish" idea comes in (more on this in "What is Wrong"). In addition, many more people access big, well-known traditional journals, so your paper could be read by more people. However, the argument can be made that most researchers use large databases to search for specific keywords, meaning your paper will likely be read by the people in the field anyway. Finally, the perceived credibility of a journal can influence how your paper is perceived. XXXX

### Predatory Journals & Paper Mills
I should briefly mention predatory journals at this point - these are journals that will actively try to recruit you and promise you big rewards, i.e. higher metrics. Paper Mills 

## Diamond Open Access

This type of publishing uses a very similar model to tradional publishing, but it is entirely free - no publication fees (APCs), no paywall, no financial gain from publishing. The downside to this, at least for some researchers, is that Diamond Open Access

Pre-prints are a fantastic way to publish your papers quickly
