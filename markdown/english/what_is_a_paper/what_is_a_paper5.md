    Main Concept
  </div>
    Scientific publishing models differ in who pays, who can access the work, and how research is reviewed and evaluated.
</div>

<div class="ps-divider"></div>

## Traditional/ Pay-walled

If you are publishing in a traditional journal, you will have to pay <span class="ps-highlight-term">Article Processing Charges (APCs)</span>. These fees can be quite high, depending on the journal you are publishing in. Additionally, if you opt to have your paper published <span class="ps-highlight-term">Open Access</span>, the fees can be even higher. However, large, well-known journals also tend to have broad readership and strong recognition, which can increase exposure. In addition, traditional journals are indexed in major citation databases and have a Journal Impact Factor, that feed into individual <span class="ps-highlight-term">metrics</span> that can influence hiring, promotion, funding decisions, and institutional rankings, feeding into the familiar <span class="ps-highlight-term">publish or perish</span> culture.

### Predatory Journals & Paper Mills

Both predatory journals and paper mills exploit pressure within academia, such as the <span class="ps-highlight-term">publish or perish</span> culture, but they operate outside legitimate scholarly standards.

      </div>
      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        These are journals that actively solicit submissions, often through persistent email invitations that can sound flattering, and promise fast publication, impressive metrics, or international visibility. They lack genuine peer review and proper editorial standards. Their goal is financial profit, not research integrity.

        These are organisations that produce and sell fabricated or heavily manipulated manuscripts to researchers, often for a fee. This might include fake data, recycled images, or entirely invented studies. The purpose of these is to fraudulently boost and individual's metrics.

## Diamond Open Access

This type of publishing uses a very similar model to tradional publishing, but it is entirely free, with no article processing charges (APCs), no paywalls, and <span class="ps-highlight-term">no financial gain from publishing</span> for the journal. The principle is <span class="ps-highlight-term">accessibility</span>: research is freely available to read and free to publish, removing financial barriers on both sides. These works are just as rigorous than "traditional" publishing and still undergo <span class="ps-highlight-term">editorial and peer review processes</span>.

## Pre-Print

Pre-prints are a fantastic way to share your research quickly. A pre-print is a full draft of a research paper that is made publicly available <span class="ps-highlight-term">before formal peer review</span>. This allows findings to be disseminated rapidly, which can be particularly important in fast-moving fields.

## PCI & PRC Models

Both models aim to make peer review more <span class="ps-highlight-term">transparent</span>,<span class="ps-highlight-term">efficient</span>, and <span class="ps-highlight-term">less wasteful</span>. They also highlight an important point: publishing is evolving, and the traditional journal model is not the only way research can be evaluated and shared.
