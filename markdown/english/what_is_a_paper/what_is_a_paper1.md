# Okay so what even is a paper?

A "paper" is a broad umbrella term that encompasses any scholarly communication. While different fields might have specific types, in science there are a number of different types of papers.

1. Literature Reviews

These are often broad summaries of the existing literature, gathering all the current knowledge around a specific topic or question. Sometimes these can be retrospectives, which recount the history of the evidence that we have gathered to date, other times they are snapshots of what the authors consider to be the most important evidence required to understand a topic or question.

2. Systematic Review

This type sits in-between literature reviews and scientific studies. These systematically analyse all the evidence on a study to try and synthesise overarching evidence. These use papers that have already been published and do specific statistical analyses to determine the strength of difference pieces of evidence.

2. Scientific Studies 

These include original studies generating new data, as well as studies like meta-analyses, which use existing datasets that are analysed differently. Important to note, meta-analyses are different from systemic reviews.
