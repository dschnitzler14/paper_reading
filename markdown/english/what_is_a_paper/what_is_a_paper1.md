      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        These are often broad summaries of the existing literature, gathering all the existing knowledge around a specific topic or question. Sometimes these can be retrospectives, which recount the history of the evidence that we have gathered to date, other times they are snapshots of what the authors consider to be the most important evidence required to understand a topic or question. Sometimes, a literature review might be used to frame a new hypothesis. These can be a great place to start if you are trying to understand the background of a topic.

      <div class="ps-myth-title">Systematic Review</div>
      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        This type sits in-between literature reviews and scientific studies. These systematically analyse all the evidence on a study to try and synthesise overarching evidence. These use papers that have already been published and do specific statistical analyses to determine the strength of difference pieces of evidence.

      <div class="ps-myth-text">
        These use existing datasets that are analysed differently, testing a new hypothesis. Important to note, meta-analyses are different from systemic reviews.

    In plain English
  </div>
    Both books and papers are important for constructing an understanding of a subject, but when you are reading scientific literature (i.e. papers), you are usually reading individual bricks. Your job is to examine how solid each one is before deciding whether it will hold up the wall of evidence you are building.
