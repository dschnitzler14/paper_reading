# If it's in a Paper it must be True!

By convention, scientific papers are written in an objective and impersonal style. This can give the impression that the findings presented are absolute truths, entirely absent of human intervention, and therefore absent of human error or fallibility.

This obviously is not true.

Remember, the authors of a paper are just humans too. All a paper is, is a recollection of one approach to answer a question. It doesn't mean that it is correct or generalisable. You could have a perfectly executed study and the only thing you can draw from it is that _this one study_ resulted in a particular set of findings. This where good stats come in too - it is clearly impossible to sample an entire population, but you can take steps to make sure results are a _good_ sample of a population. That is, if you believe you can trust these results, based on the methods and background. You may also disagree with the interpretation and extrapolation of these results.

In fact, even though some papers may be widely cited, these studies may still have some flaws that make you distrust the results.

It is up to you to decide how much weight you give a study and it's findings.

But how do you judge if the paper is worth believing? And what do you do with that understanding then?
