# History of publishing

Scholarly communications have always been the backbone of scientific advances. Nobody ever works alone and we continue to build on the foundations of others. Writing and publishing a book takes a lot of time and effort, so brief communications in journals facilitated the rapid dissemination of results, allowing others to build on your work, as well as preventing a duplication of efforts.

Unfortunately, this also became a way to stake one's claim over a particular finding - essentially the equivalent of trolling "first" in the comments.

Primarily though, the purpose of publication is to share your knowledge and results in order to advance the field.

Today, we are no longer reliant on print journals, quickly accessing papers online.
